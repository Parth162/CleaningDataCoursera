# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set as the part of John Hopkins University course on getting and cleaning data.

## Instructors

The course is taught by:

* Jeff Leek, Phd
* Roger D. Peng, Phd
* Brian Caffo, Phd

## Files Submitted

The following files have been included in this repo:
1. the script "run_analysis.R"
2. a code book "CodeBook.wd" that describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that performed to clean up the data
3. the tidy data set "Tidydataset.txt" produced by the script
4. the present "README.md" file

## Packages Required

The only extra packages that are used are dplyr and plyr. If not installed then they should be installed.
